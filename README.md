# statstee

_The Cross-Platform Proxyless Command Line UI for StatsD Metrics_

![Demo Animation of UI](/example/images/demo.gif?raw=true)

The `statstee` utility collects and plots metrics emitted from other processes on a host without interrupting or proxying their flow to the [StatsD daemon][statsd] or subsequent backend services.

`statstee` relies on [libpcap][libpcap] ([WinPcap][winpcap] for Windows) to capture the UDP metric datagrams off the network. Values are bucketed in one-second intervals and plots are shown depending on the metric datatype. Current and moving averages are also provided for each graph.

## Features

- [x] Cross-Platform (OSX / Linux / Windows)
- [x] Proxyless capture mode (daemon and processes can still use default host/port)
- [x] Listener mode if no daemon is present (prevents packet loss)
- [x] [Configurable](#usage) with sensible defaults (loopback interface, port 8125)
- [x] Supports all StatsD metric data-types ([gauge](#gauge), [counter](#counter), [set](#set), [timing](#timing--histogram-datadog))
- [x] Supports DataDog histogram metrics (treated like standard StatsD timing)
- [x] Graphed time-series for each metric type
- [x] Current value with 1-, 5- & 10-minute moving averages (EWMA)

### Planned Features

- [ ] Filter/search support
- [ ] Sample rate support
- [ ] DataDog [events][dd-events] and [service checks][dd-checks]
- [ ] Save and/or replay metric data

### Gauge

* Current Value

* Cumulative Count

### Set

* Percent Unique

![Set Metrics](/example/images/set.png?raw=true)

### Timing / Histogram (DataDog)

* Count / RPS
* Median
* 75<sup>th</sup> Percentile
* 95<sup>th</sup> Percentile

## Install

Static binaries for many major platforms are forthcoming. For now, please refer to the [development section](#development) for installation instructions.

## Usage

```
â†’ statstee -h
Usage of dist/statstee:
  -c bool
     force capture mode, even if StatsD is not present
  -d string
      network device to capture on (default "_first_loopback_")
  -l bool
      force listen mode, error if the port cannot be bound
  -p int
      port to capture on (default 8125)
  -v bool
      display debug output to statstee.log
```

**NB:** You will likely need to run `statstee` as root or with `sudo` in order to snoop on the network traffic.

## Development

_Requires Go 1.5 or Higher_

#### Install libpcap for your OS & architecture

* **OSX:** `brew install libpcap`
* **Ubuntu/Debian:** `apt-get install libpcap-dev`
* **Windows:** [run installer][winpcap-install]

#### Download statstee

`go get github.com/rodaine/statstee`

#### Run tests

`script/bootstrap && script/test`

#### Build executables

`script/bootstrap && script/build`

#### Run executables

* `dist/statstee -v` - This app, with logging to `./statstee.log`!
* `dist/statter` - Demo app for experimenting (outputs all metric types)
* `dist/jerks -n 1 -r 1000` - Load testing app (`n` metrics at `r` rps)
